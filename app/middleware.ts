// NOW THE LAST THING LEFT IS TO USE IMAGEKIT IN FRONTEND! so see imagekit docs->Nextjs->client side code.
//here basically we can call the API route to retrieve the upload parameters, read more there and see the code.
//earlier there were providers in v1 of imagekit, previously all components of the page were supposed to know that you're authenticated with imagekit or not.
//so let's go to the components folder inside app folder. Provider-this is a wrapper that just takes the childeren and renders them.
